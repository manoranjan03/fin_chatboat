International Fund Transfer & Sanctions Compliance Policy
This document is a sample policy created for educational and personal project purposes only. It does not constitute
legal advice or regulatory guidance.
1. Purpose

cross-border entities while ensuring compliance with international sanctions regimes, including those administered
by the United Nations (UN) and the United States (US).

transfers involving customers, counterparties, intermediaries, correspondent banks, and beneficiaries located
outside the domestic jurisdiction.
3. Regulatory and Sanctions Framework

• United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Sanctions Regimes
• US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Sanctions Programs
• Applicable regional or local sanctions laws where relevant
4. Prohibited Transactions
The organization shall not process any fund transfer that directly or indirectly involves:

• Transactions intended to circumvent or evade sanctions controls
5. Customer and Transaction Due Diligence
